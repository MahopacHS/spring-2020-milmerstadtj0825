How many times must you execute this program and check the output before you canbe reasonably assured your code is correct? Explain.\n\nAnswer:  33 times because you want to use a value above 600, a negative value, a word, the 2 #'s that are on the boundary of the cutoff (ex: 0 and 600, 480 and 509, etc.) and a value in the middle of each range. \n\n\n3. When testing this program do you think its more important to test numbers in the middle of the grade range or exactly on the boundary between one grade range and the next. Justify your response.\n\nAnswer:  In the middle because there's a probability that more grades that will fall in the middle than on the boundary. \n\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\nI was able to code this without any help, but it took a lot of trial and error. Compared to all the other practices though, this one took a shorter amount of time, which probably means that I'm learning and getting better. Now that my code is correct, I understand why and how it works, as well as the layout of it. The difference between try...except and if...else confuses me, but this lesson helped me understand it a little bit more. "

Our criteria will be as follows.\n\n- Is it the weekend? Then sleep in.\n- Is it a holiday? Then sleep in.\n- Otherwise you need to get up!\n\nLet's write a program to input the day of the week and ask whether or not its a holiday, then make the appropriate decision as to whether or not we should sleep in.\n\nWe will use the **Write - Refactor - Test - Rewrite** approach to complete the final solution which will refactor the day of the week logic into a function."

Why did we need to write 7 tests?\n\nAnswer: No, only 3 (Saturday, Sunday, Monday)\n\n\n3. Which code is easier to understand? Step 1 or step 4? Why? or Why not?\n\nAnswer: Step 1 because everything is infront of you while in step 4 you have to bounce between difference cells as the code is run through the function. \n\n\n4. What happens when you input `'sat'` for `'Saturday'` Does it work? How can the program be improved? Does improving it affect the readability of step 4? (HINT: Abstractions!!!)\n\nAnswer: It doesn't work because the function is programmed to only understands \"Saturday\" not \"Sat\". It can be improved by being programmed to understand all versions of the word \"Saturday.\" Yes it can help because then you don't have to worry about inputting the day of the week in a certain way.

Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise?

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\nThis assignment was difficult because I wasn't sure what URL to use and what key to use. This unit is also confusing for me when it comes to figuring out how to code the different variables. After watching Faitakes' helpful video though, I was able to figure it out. Once I finished my code, I further understood it by seeing what is in the conditions dictionary and what's in conditions['currently']. Doing this helped me further understand what's happening behind the scenes. The hardest part of this I feel is knowing how to code the different types of error handling. "

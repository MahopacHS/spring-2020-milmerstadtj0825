Is this an error?\n\nAnswer:  it still runs because it's still an integar. \n\n\n2. Would it be difficult to write a program which did the opposite (conversion F to C)? Explain.\n\nAnswer:  No because you would just have to change the formula.  \n\n3. Did you store the conversion in a variable before printing it on the last line? I argue this makes your program easier to understand. Why? \n\nAnswer:   Yes because fahrenheit is equal to that formula. This helps the computer understand what to print\n\n\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\nI understood this lesson and liked involving math with coding. I also understood the difference between integars and floats which took me a while to understand in the beginning. I got the coding correct on the first try but changed my coding a few times to perfect it and make it look better. \n"
